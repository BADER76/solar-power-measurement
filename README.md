## Project Overview

The Solar Power Measurement System is designed to provide accurate readings of solar energy production. This system can help users monitor their solar panels' performance and optimize energy usage. It integrates various components to create a seamless monitoring experience.

### Key Components:
- **STM32 Microcontroller**: Acts as the brain of the system.
- **Voltage and Current Sensors**: Measure the electrical parameters.
- **OLED Display**: Provides real-time feedback on power metrics.
- **ThingSpeak**: Cloud platform for IoT data storage and visualization.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of voltage and current.
- Cloud-based data storage for easy access.
- OLED display for immediate feedback.
- User-friendly interface for data visualization.
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements.

## Components Used

1. **STM32 Microcontroller**
   - Powerful and efficient, ideal for embedded systems.

2. **Voltage Sensor**
   - Measures voltage levels from the solar panel.

3. **Current Sensor**
   - Monitors the current flowing through the system.

4. **OLED Display**
   - Displays real-time data and system status.

5. **ThingSpeak**
   - Cloud service for IoT applications, allowing data visualization and analytics.

6. **Power Supply**
   - Provides the necessary power for the components.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Solar Power Measurement System, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BADER76/solar-power-measurement.git
   cd solar-power-measurement
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**
   Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed for STM32 development.

3. **Connect the Hardware**
   Follow the wiring diagram provided in the documentation to connect all components.

## Installation

1. **Hardware Setup**
   - Connect the voltage and current sensors to the STM32.
   - Attach the OLED display for visual feedback.
   - Ensure the ThingSpeak API key is correctly configured in the code.

2. **Software Setup**
   - Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., STM32CubeIDE).
   - Upload the firmware to the STM32 microcontroller.

## Usage

Once everything is set up, power on the system. The OLED display will show real-time readings of voltage and current. The data will also be sent to ThingSpeak for cloud monitoring.

### Example Readings
- Voltage: 24.5V
- Current: 3.2A
